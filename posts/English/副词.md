...地/得
辅助 

## 副词的妙用
- 动词 
	- He studies **hard**. 
	- 修饰不及物动词一般放在动词后
	- My sister studied English hard
	- 修饰及物动词一般放在宾语后面
- 形容词 
	- He is **very** clever.
	- 修饰adj/adv,一般放在被修饰的adj/adv前
- 副词 
	- I studied so hard.
- 句子 
	- Luckily, I passed the exam.

## 总有例外

> I didn't have **enough** clothes to last a week
> I was old enough to work and earn money.
> We didn't leave early enough.
> 一般作**形容词或限定词**,放在名词前. 
> 作副词一般就放在形容词或副词之后

> I teach him English there.
> She often comes here
> I sometimes gothere
> **Does** she often **come** here?
> Why does she often come here?
> She often comes here because she likes it.
> He always goes there.
> Does he always come there?
> Why does he always come there?
> He always goes there because he doesn't like to come here.

today 今天 
tonight 今晚
now 现在
early 早地/的
late 晚地/的

> We learn history today.
> We learn English today.
> Do we learn English today?
> She comes late.
> Does she come late?

地点与时间均习惯被放在句尾. 
若同时存在,则先写地点,后写时间. 
> they are here now. 
> you learn history here today.
> We are going to sing here tonight.
> He comes there early.

## 程度副词
